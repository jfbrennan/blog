## <uitk-loader> and Custom HTML Tags

# Intro
Product Design recently spec’ed a new version of the UITK Loader and since we had just finished The View Showdown (more on that in a future post), we were curious to see how it could be built with one of the newer view libraries like React.

We already rebuilt UITK Alert with these libraries as a POC, so we knew what it took for a medium-sized component, but we hadn’t tried to create a small component like Loader. It became apparent that the solution in every case would unfortunately be over-engineered.
